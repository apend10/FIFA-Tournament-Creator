# Game Description
Firstly, everyone creates their own team from scratch. For each of the eleven starting positions, every player will reeive a pick. For example, participant A can get the first pick for ST while possibly getting the last pick for GK and so on. However, a pick doesn't mean they get to choose any player they want. Each pick will have a range of ratings. For example if participant A gets the first pick for ST, then they will receive a rating randomly in the range of 88 to 94. If that rating is 89, it means that they have to pick a striker with a rating less than or equal to 90. This format is applied for all positions and participants. Also, the same player cannot be chosen by two participants.
